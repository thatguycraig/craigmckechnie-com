Dropbox is working with Vagrant flawlessly thus far! Setting us the Vagrant "Getting Started Guide" that includes 
Apache for localhost viewing within the browser when viewing '127.0.0.1:4568"

Not only that! While Dropbox handles the syncing of the working files in the cloud, GitHub (or BitBucket if I install it) 
we now have functioning version control!! So, all this with Vagrant handling the Virtual Machine environment thanks to 
VirtualBox... I now have a new workflow in place! And it's EPICCCCCCC!!!!!!

I <3 Dropbox + Vagrant + Git
